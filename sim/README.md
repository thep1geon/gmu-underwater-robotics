# Simulation

My best attempt at a physics engine + 3D renderer built from the bottom up for the
most control for our specific use case. Written in pure C with a few dependecies.

Along side the simulation, I will be most likely be building up a C library for
common utilities that'll probably get its own repo eventually.

## Dependecies (so far)

-   GNU Make
-   OpenGL (duh)
-   GLFW (windowing)

## Contribution

As stated in the main README for the repo, adhere to coding styles or your code
might not be merged.

# NOTE

If I am the only person working on this, I get to make all the decisions.
I am writting it targeting GNU/Linux platforms, I couldn't care less for Windows.

So if you want to run it, either fix the code or use Linux.
